# Issue Reporter Bot
A Discord bot for automatically creating GitHub issues when a bug report is submit in a given Discord channel. Feel free to use this bot for your own servers and projects (see `template.env` for an idea on how to set it up for yourself).

_You can see this bot in action in Wanderer's Guide's [Discord server](https://discord.gg/kxCpa6G) and [generated issues](https://github.com/wanderers-guide/wanderers-guide/issues)._
